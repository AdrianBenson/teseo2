This is your plugin's TODO list.


Thu Aug  4 17:16:58 CEST 2005
- Fix old TESEO_DATA with new ...
	* Improve get_teseo_environment_path()
        * does it check for a file teseorc?
        * Does Gimp ever use $HOME/.gimp-x.x directory? I think so.
- Display filename on window win_teseo () (?)
- Path menu porting from teseo 1 to 2
- Manage lock mechanism:
	* when the program crash and does not remove the file lock
	* when quit gimp and the plug-in has not been closed before


Sun Aug  7 19:49:52 CEST 2005
- Event pathname and time mark pathname in Properties-->Traces


Tue Aug  9 14:13:53 CEST 2005
- Specify when we are working with polyline and when with bezier curve


Wed Aug 10 17:27:46 CEST 2005
- Porting on Windows
- Define source pack distribution (teseo-2.x.x.tar.gz)
- Define binary pack distribution (Linux, Mac, Windows)
    * define a makefile to compile a static binary
    * Include pixmaps and help files in binary distribution
    * installation software o.s. dependent
    	Linux-Unix: shell script ?
	MAC OS X:  shell script ?
	Windows:   .exe?	
- Change the path order when link or align them (?)
	* Now the order is from the bottom to the top in Paths tool (Standar in GIMP (?))


Sat Aug 13 11:27:26 CEST 2005
- It is possibile to center image on a point? (Submit to mailinglists, forums, discussions,...)
- Alternative exit condition from execution steps based on coordinates limit, using guide
- Teseo works from left to right. Do we want consider other directions? NO
- Print path for debug (type 3, BEZIER_MOVE)
- gimp_path_get_points() fails when path contains more piecewise...
    Gimp-Vectors-WARNING **: gimp_vectors_compat_get_points(): convert failed
        until gimp-2.3.3,  function is the same...
- gimp_path_get_points use g_new, check if g_free() is needed!!! We never used it... Now I add it!
- check where g_free is needed !!!
- Write a function to "open" a closed path


Sun Aug 21 10:46:44 CEST 2005
- Omologate by glib functions
    * Use GString, g_printf, g_sprintf,
    * Glib File Utilities
- Omologate output message
        see developer.gimp.org/api/2.0/glib/glib-Message-Logging.html#g-warning
    * (i.e.  "Teseo2-Warning: function_name(): messsage")
    * Use english language
    * use g_message for official errors and warnings
    * use g_printf for essential debug messages
    * g_print() should not be used from within libraries for debugging messages,
        since it may be redirected by applications to special purpose message windows or even files.
        Instead, libraries should use g_log(), or the convenience functions g_message(), g_warning() and g_error().
- Don't modify locked path !!!!!!!


Fri Aug 26 11:15:21 CEST 2005
- Write a function to "snap" every point of a polyline path. It could be executed iteratively.


Fri Sep  2 08:30:36 CEST 2005
