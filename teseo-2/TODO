This is your plugin's TODO list.

- Fix old TESEO_DATA with new ...
	* Improve get_teseo_environment_path() * does it check for a file teseorc?
- Display filename on window win_teseo ()
- Catch parameter from session, for example to run algorithm or operation on path
- Path menu porting from teseo 1 to 2
- Manage lock mechanism:
	* when the program crash and does not remove the file lock
	* when quit gimp and the plug-in has not been closed before

- Omologate by glib functions
- Event pathname and time mark pathname in Properties-->Traces

- Specify when we are working with polyline and when with bezier curve

- Porting on Windows
- Define source pack distribution (teseo-2.x.x.tar.gz)
- Define binary pack distribution (Linux, Mac, Windows)
    * installation software o.s. dependent
    	Linux-Unix: shell script ?
	MAC OS X:  shell script ?
	Windows:   .exe?	
- Change the path order when link or align them (?)
	* Now the order is from the bottom to the top in Paths tool

- It is possibile to center image on a point? (Submit to mailinglists, forums, discussions,...)
- Add split path function (using guide?)
- Alternative exit condition from execution steps based on coordinates limit
- Teseo work from right to left. Do we want consider other direction?
- Print path for debug (type 3, BEZIER_MOVE)
- gimp_path_get_points() fails when path contains more piecewise...
	 Gimp-Vectors-WARNING **: gimp_vectors_compat_get_points(): convert failed
- gimp_path_get_points use g_new, check if g_free() is needed!!! We have never used it...
- Write a function to "open" a closed path
- Include pixmaps and help files in binary distribution
