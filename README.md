# Teseo2: Turn the Eldest Seismograms into the Electronic Original Ones

Teseo2 is a software tool for quick and accurate digitization/vectorization of seismogram traces from raster files.

It has been developed in the framework of the Sismos project [Michelini and the Sismos Team, 2005] at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (Italy). This name was inspired by the myth of Theseus and it is also an acronym for Turn the Eldest Seismograms into the Electronic Original Ones.

Teseo2 is a plug-in for GIMP - GNU Image Manipulation Program - that extends its functionalities for seismological studies. The GIMP is a multiplatform photo manipulation tool freely distributed. It works on many operating systems, in many languages.

Teseo2 allows primarily for:

  - additional operations on the vectorized trace (i.e. resampling and alignment)
  - supervised vectorization algorithms (colour weighted mean)
  - analysis after trace vectorization, such as curvature correction and time realignment
  - trace import/export in several formats (such as SAC, SVG, DXF, ASCII, Timemarks distances).

In order to keep track of the stages and parameters of a seismogram vectorization, Teseo2 is able to write this information into the image saved in xcf format.

Teseo2 is developed following the "Open-Source" philosophy and it is freely distributed under GPL license. It is cross-platform and the sources, the binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, are periodically updated on the Sismos web site.
